# ParticleSteps

![ParticleSteps in action](./demo/particlesteps.gif)

This is a [processing](https://processing.org) sketch that generates verticle 
particle exposions on key press and mouse click.

## Interactions

This sketch was created to be used with a controller I made that maps the keys
'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'space' and the mouse click as input.  The sketch will therefor
also take these inputs from a standard keyboard and mouse as well.  

When an input is received a verticle particle explosion occurs somewhere within 
a range across the horizontal field of view.  Each key maps to a subsection of 
the horizontal field of view.
